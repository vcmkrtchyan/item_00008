Ok, here's how you can implement a ToDo-List Web App using React and TypeScript, allowing users to add and remove tasks
from a ToDo List. Each task consists of a title, description, and duration. There is no need for a database connection,
and the ToDo List should reset when the user refreshes the webpage.

Here's how you can run the project

```
yarn dev
```

This code provides a basic ToDo-List app using React and TypeScript, handling task creation, removal, and display
without persistent storage.
